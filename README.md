## Overview

This is GNU Mailman, a mailing list management system distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3 or later. Mailman is written in Python which is available for all platforms that Mailman is supported on, including GNU/Linux and most other Unix-like operating systems (e.g. Solaris, *BSD, MacOSX, etc.).

## Demo

* [Official demo](https://lists.mailman3.org/mailman3/lists/)

No user/password is provided, so you must sign up.

## Post-installation steps

### Setup Admin User

You must [configure the admin user](http://docs.mailman3.org/en/latest/config-web.html#setting-up-admin-account):

```bash
$ cd /usr/share/mailman3-web
$ python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

You should then attempt to log in with this user account in the web UI. Once you've logged in, a confirmation mail will be sent to your email address that you specified. Therefore, you should have something like [Rainloop](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/rainloop_ynh) installed to view mail on your YunoHost installation.

## Configuration

Mailman3 is made up of 3 moving parts:

* Mailman3 Core: https://mailman.readthedocs.io
* Postorious: https://postorius.readthedocs.io
* Hyperkitty: https://hyperkitty.readthedocs.io

There is also documentation for "the suite" which is all the parts together:

* https://docs.mailman3.org

On your YunoHost, all the configuration files you need to worry about are in:

* `/etc/mailman3/`

It is important to note that this package makes use of the [mailman3-full](http://docs.mailman3.org/en/latest/prodsetup.html#distribution-packages) Debian package contained in the Debian Stretch backports repository.
