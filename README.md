## Disclaimers / important information

* Any known limitations, constrains or stuff not working, such as (but not limited to):
    * requiring a full dedicated domain

* Other infos that people should be aware of, such as:
    * No LDAP support yet (apparently under development)
    * Users can also just sign up themselves to manage details
    * Users can use mailing lists without signing up?

Classical admin is available on the page: https://myyunohost.org/

Django admin on: https://myyunohost.org/admin/

## General Configuration

Mailman 3 or "The Mailman Suite" is made up of 5 moving parts. See the following documentation for more:

> http://docs.mailman3.org/en/latest/index.html#the-mailman-suite

On your YunoHost, all the configuration files you need to worry about are in:

* `/etc/mailman3/`
* `/usr/share/mailman3-web/`

The services you need to manage can be checked with:

* `systemctl status mailman3`
* `systemctl status mailman3-web`

It is important to note that this package makes use of the [mailman3-full](http://docs.mailman3.org/en/latest/prodsetup.html#distribution-packages) Debian package contained in the Debian Stretch backports repository. The default installation assumes the use of a SQLite3 database but the installation script overrides this and uses a PostgreSQL database instead.

Finally, you also configure things through the Django web admin available at `/admin/`.

## Limitations

* Migrating from Mailman 2.X is not officially supported, sorry. However, there is a manual and
  which details an experimental process. Please see [the documentation](https://docs.mailman3.org/en/latest/migration.html).

* Mailman3 must be configured to use a root domain (https://myyunohost.org and not https://myyunohost.org/mailman3).

* You must have a HTTPS certificate installed on the root domain.

* There may be only one installation per YunoHost.
